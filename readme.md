###Get Your Show on the road!!

##Technology Used
To build this app, I used: Sinatra-Rails, Bootstrap, Google Maps Api/Geocode, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, postgreSQL, and Active Record.

##Approach Taken 
I began with a planning and wireframing phase, so that I could visually map out each path for my CRUD actions. I used these wireframes to produce my user stories and move from my planning stage to development. Once I had my CRUD actions created, I added delete and edit buttons for a better user's experience. I then set up views--for each respective page and the general layout of the app. I then wanted to display all events on a map, so users will be able to find a venue that is local to them; I used Google Maps and Geocoder, to accomplish this. One of my 'Ice Box' goals was to add the map to my show page, so that users can find the venue that they have selected by address and see it visually--on a map. 

##Installation Instructions
To contribute to this, you may want to use the Sinatra requirements and gem, bootstrap gem, require activerecord and have its gem installed, you must install geocoder and require it in the model--before the class model--, you must have postgresql, googlemaps-api-key link, in addition to bootstrap and jquery CDNs.    

##Unsolved Problems
I am still working on making each map marker clickable, so that it will link to a showpage with more information. I would also like to create profiles for login purposes; users shouldn't be able to delete another user's venue or update their information, without prior authorization.
